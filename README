== Installation

This plugin doesn't depend on anything except the Ruby standard library

To install the plugin itself, simply just drop the whole directory into your application's "vendor/plugins" directory. 
  Starting with version 1.0rc of rails, it will be automatically picked for you by rails plugin mechanism.

Don't forget to generate rdoc
rake doc:plugins

For more information about different options, 
please download the latest version Fraktjakt's API-documentation at:
http://www.fraktjakt.se/services/download

While you develop and tests your installation you should set :debug to true. This will send your calls to the test-server
and prevent you from making any real orders. 


=== Configuration Possibilities with Fraktjakt

	Selection of which shipping services your customers may choose when they 
        make purchases in your web shop;
	Selection of whether to sort the shipping alternatives by time or price when 
        they are presented to your customers; 
	Selection of whether shipping time will be displayed as Number of days or Arrival time; 
	Selection of Free shipping when a customer's purchase exceeds a specific amount;
	Setting a price for picking up a product in person instead of having it shipped; 
	Definition of optional standard box dimensions, if you want Fraktjakt to use these;
	Selection of which days shippers can pick up products for delivery;
	Definition of pick-up times, if applicable.


=== Useful functions 

	Fraktjakt can handle all products in the customer's shopping cart, 
        regardless of whether they are sent as separate 
	parcels or if multiple products are packaged together in a standard box. 
	Fraktjakt allows you to define the dimensions of individual products. This 
        provides more exact price calculations.
	Fraktjakt can determine which products in your customer's shopping cart will fit into your 
        standard boxes and base the shipping prices on your standard box size. 
        This is normally cheaper than basing the shipping prices on the dimensions of 
        your individual products.  
	Fraktjakt estimates delivery times based on your settings,
        i.e. which days shippers can come and pick up products for delivery, along with any specific 
        pick-up times that you may have defined. 
	Your customers only see the shipping alternatives that you want them to be able to choose. 
	When your customers choose delivery that is not door-to-door, they are shown the nearest pick-up location and 
	      how far it is from their address to that location.
	Fraktjakt provides links to maps that help your customers locate pick-up locations.
	Fraktjakt prepares booking and pick-up of one or more shipments. 
	Frakt creates shipping documents for both domestic and international shipments, 
        to be printed out on your own printer.
